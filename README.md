ASM byte-code manipulation	framework [1] to build an automated coverage collection tool that can capture the statement coverage for the program under test. The tool can be applied to real-world	Java	projects (>1000 lines of code) with JUnit tests (>50 tests) from GitHub [2] to collect the statement coverage for its JUnit tests.	Note	that	your	tool	should	(1)	use	Java	Agent	 [3]	to	perform	on-the-fly	code	instrumentation,	(2)	be	able	to	store	the	coverage	for	each	test	 method	in	the	file	system,	and	(3)	be	integrated	with	the	Maven	build	system	[4]	so	that	your	 tool	can	be	triggered	by	simply	typing	“mvn	test”	after	changing	the	pom.xml	file	of	the	project	 under	test.
